# TensorFlow_learn
This is a repository for some of the tensorflow-based machine learning models I have used. There are FCN based semantic segmentation models, LSTM prediction models, CNN based satellite image recognition models and cat and dog recognition models, custom training models, softmax multivariate classification, keras based multi-layer perceptron models, tensorboard usage and more. Unfortunately most of my notes in the code are in Chinese and I did not upload the dataset together because it was too large. In order to use some of this code, first you have to install the relevant libraries, then modify your data url and change the `txt` file suffix to `py`.
